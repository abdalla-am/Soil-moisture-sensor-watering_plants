# 🔵Soil-moisture-sensor-watering_plants🔵

🌱💧  This is a project that cointains arduino code for a soil moisture sensor using ardiono UNO and a soil moisture sensor.

  <p>💻🖥 The project was done for Robotech summer training 2020-2021 FCIS ASU. </p>

## Keep World healthy 🌎 🌍 🌏

## Why we should water the plants continuously ? 🤔
#### Water enters a plant through its stem and travels up to its leaves. When a plant is properly hydrated, there is enough water pressure to make the leaves strong and sturdy; when a plant doesn't get enough water, the pressure inside the stems and leaves drops and they wilt. Plants also need water for photosynthesis.

## Underwatering 💧 Vs Overwatering 💦 :
####  `Underwatering`  plants causes dry leaves, brown tips, leaf drop, wilting, and leaf curling. The soil will feel dry, but the plant will improve after watering ,`Overwatering` causes yellowing leaves, brown tips, wilting despite wet soil, and also symptoms of underwatering if root rot has started.
